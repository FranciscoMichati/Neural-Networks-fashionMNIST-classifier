# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a classification task using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model to predict the correct label for a given image of clothing.

## Features

* Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification tasks
* Use of PyTorch for building and training the models
* Data loading and preprocessing using PyTorch's `DataLoader` and `Dataset` classes
* Training and testing loops with logging and evaluation metrics

## Requirements

* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run scripts: `python src/CNN.py` or `python src/perceptron.py`
